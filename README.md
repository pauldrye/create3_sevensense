# create3_sevensense

The repository contains the demonstration video of the irobot create3 executing the tasks asked in the coding test :
 - Undocking
 - Drawing letter (D)
 - Docking

The code is uploaded on master branch. 
The file used (test.sh) is located in ~/src/create3_sim/
I worked on a additional task,which was to generalize the drawing of path based on an svg-path file. I did not succeed in finishing the module, but the package is available in svg_drive_goals. It is rough work, and is not complete or acheieved by any mean.
